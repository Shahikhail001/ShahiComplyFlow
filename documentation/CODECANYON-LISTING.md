### ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Does this plugin guarantee legal compliance?**  
A: ComplyFlow provides powerful tools to help you meet regulatory requirements, but it does not constitute legal advice. We recommend consulting an attorney for your specific compliance strategy. The plugin gives you the technical infrastructure to implement compliance measures effectively.

**Q: Will it slow down my website?**  
A: No. ComplyFlow is performance-optimized with <50ms frontend overhead. All heavy processing (scanning, reporting) happens in the admin area. The consent banner loads asynchronously and doesn't block page rendering. Tested and verified to meet performance benchmarks.

**Q: Is WooCommerce integration included?**  
A: Yes! ComplyFlow has deep WooCommerce integration. DSR data exports automatically include customer data, order history, product reviews, addresses, and payment methods (non-sensitive). The consent banner also detects WooCommerce cookies.

**Q: Can I customize the consent banner design?**  
A: Absolutely. Full customization available: colors, fonts, text, position, button labels, cookie categories. Supports custom CSS for advanced styling. Multiple position options (top, bottom, modal overlay). Mobile-responsive out of the box.

**Q: How does geo-targeting work?**  
A: ComplyFlow detects visitor location via IP geolocation and shows the appropriate consent banner. EU visitors see GDPR-compliant opt-in banner, California visitors see CCPA "Do Not Sell" link, etc. You can customize behavior per region or disable geo-targeting.

**Q: Does it support multisite?**  
A: Yes, fully multisite compatible. Network-activate for all sites or activate per-site with individual configurations. Centralized compliance management for agencies managing multiple client sites.

**Q: What languages are supported?**  
A: ComplyFlow is translation-ready with full i18n support. .pot file included for easy translation to any language. Compatible with WPML, Polylang, and TranslatePress. Consent banner text fully customizable per language.

**Q: Can I export accessibility reports?**  
A: Yes! Scan results export as professional PDF reports with your branding. Perfect for sharing with clients, stakeholders, or legal teams. CSV export also available for data analysis.

**Q: Is there an API for developers?**  
A: Yes! Comprehensive REST API for programmatic access to compliance data. Plus 50+ WordPress action hooks and filters for customization. Full developer documentation included.

**Q: How long are consent logs stored?**  
A: Configurable retention period (default 12 months) per GDPR Article 30 requirements. IP addresses automatically anonymized before storage (/24 subnet). Complete audit trail maintained.

**Q: Does it work with page builders?**  
A: Yes! Tested and compatible with Elementor, Beaver Builder, Divi, and WPBakery Page Builder. Accessibility scanner analyzes page builder content without issues.

**Q: What happens to data if I uninstall?**  
A: Deactivating preserves all data. Uninstalling (deleting) removes all custom database tables, options, and stored data. Clean uninstall ensures no database bloat.

**Q: Can I schedule automated scans?**  
A: Yes! Both accessibility scans and cookie scans support scheduling (hourly, daily, weekly, monthly). Email notifications alert you to new issues. WP-Cron based for reliable scheduling.

**Q: Is my data safe?**  
A: Absolutely. ComplyFlow follows WordPress security best practices: sanitized inputs, prepared SQL statements, nonce verification, capability checks. No data transmitted to external servers. All compliance data stored locally in your WordPress database.

**Q: Do you offer support?**  
A: Yes! 6 months premium support included with purchase. Submit questions via CodeCanyon item comments or dedicated support email. Average response time <24 hours on business days. Extended support available for purchase.
