# Build and Deployment

## Overview
Set up, build, and deploy ComplyFlow using modern tools and best practices.

## Key Concepts
- **Vite Build Pipeline**: Fast asset bundling and hot reload for development.
- **Asset Optimization**: Minification, concatenation, and cache-busting for production.
- **Code Quality Enforcement**: PHPCS, PHPStan, ESLint, and Prettier for code standards.
- **Automated Testing**: PHPUnit and static analysis for reliability.

## Steps
1. Install dependencies with Composer and NPM.
2. Build assets with `npm run build`.
3. Run code quality checks before deployment.
4. Deploy to your server or marketplace.

## Tips
- Use version control (Git) for all code changes.
- Automate builds and tests with CI/CD pipelines.
