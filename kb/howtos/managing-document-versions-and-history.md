# Managing Document Versions and History

## Overview
Track, review, and restore previous versions of your legal documents for compliance and transparency.

## Steps
1. Go to **WordPress Admin → ComplyFlow → Legal Documents**.
2. Click **Edit** on the desired policy.
3. Click the **Version History** button (backup icon).
4. Review the timeline of all saved versions, including timestamps and user info.
5. Click **View** to preview a version, or **Restore** to roll back to a previous version.

## Tips
- Each save creates a new version automatically.
- Use the diff viewer to compare changes between versions.
- Rollback is safe and does not delete any previous versions.
