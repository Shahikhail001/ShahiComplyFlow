# Module Initialization Failures

## Problem
Some plugin modules (e.g., Consent, Accessibility, DSR) do not load or function as expected.

## Solution
- Check that all dependencies are installed and assets are built.
- Review the plugin settings to ensure the module is enabled.
- Look for error messages in the WordPress debug log.
- Deactivate and reactivate the plugin to reinitialize modules.

## Tips
- Update to the latest version of ComplyFlow for bug fixes.
- Contact support with error logs if the issue persists.
