# Legal Document Generator

## What is the Legal Document Generator?
The Legal Document Generator automates the creation, management, and publishing of privacy policies, terms of service, and cookie policies. It ensures your documents are always up-to-date and compliant with GDPR, CCPA, and other regulations.

## Key Features

### 1. Guided Questionnaire
- **Step-by-Step Process**: An 8-step wizard collects all required information (company details, data types, legal basis, vendors, retention, user rights, cookies, contact info).
- **Auto-Detection**: Automatically detects installed plugins (WooCommerce, analytics, forms) and includes relevant legal clauses.
- **Customizable Templates**: Choose from pre-built templates or create your own for each policy type.
- **Smart Suggestions**: The system recommends sections based on your answers and detected plugins.

### 2. Version Control & History
- **History Tracking**: Every change creates a new version, with timestamp, user, and summary.
- **Diff Viewer**: Compare any two versions side-by-side, with color-coded highlights for additions, removals, and changes.
- **Rollback**: Instantly restore any previous version if needed.
- **Audit Trail**: Full log of who changed what and when, for compliance.

### 3. Publishing Options
- **Shortcodes**: Embed any policy on a WordPress page or post using a simple shortcode.
- **PDF Export**: Generate a print-ready PDF of any policy for sharing or archiving.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Create and manage policies in multiple languages, with translation-ready templates.
- **Auto-Update**: Policies can be set to auto-update when laws change (with admin review).

### 4. Editing & Customization
- **Rich Text Editor**: Edit policies with a WYSIWYG editor (TinyMCE), HTML view, and live preview.
- **Section Management**: Add, remove, or reorder policy sections as needed.
- **Custom Clauses**: Insert your own legal text or custom clauses.

## How to Use
1. **Start the Questionnaire**: Go to ComplyFlow → Legal Documents and click “Create New Policy.”
2. **Complete Each Step**: Fill in company info, select data types, legal basis, vendors, retention, user rights, cookies, and contact details.
3. **Review & Edit**: Use the editor to make final adjustments, preview, and save.
4. **Publish**: Embed the policy on your site with a shortcode or export as PDF.
5. **Manage Versions**: Use the version history to track changes and restore previous versions if needed.
