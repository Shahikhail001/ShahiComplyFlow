# Custom Script and Tracker Handling

## Overview
Manage custom scripts and trackers to ensure they comply with consent and privacy requirements.

## Steps
1. Go to **WordPress Admin → ComplyFlow → Settings → Consent Manager**.
2. Use the Script Blocker to add patterns for custom scripts (e.g., marketing pixels, analytics, widgets).
3. Assign each script to the appropriate consent category.
4. Test your site to ensure scripts are blocked until consent is given.
5. Review the Cookie Inventory to verify new trackers are detected and categorized.

## Tips
- Regularly audit custom scripts after site changes.
- Use manual cookie entry for scripts that set cookies outside of standard detection.
- Document all custom scripts for compliance audits.
