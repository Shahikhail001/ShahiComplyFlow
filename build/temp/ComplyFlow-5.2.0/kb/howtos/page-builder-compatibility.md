# Page Builder Compatibility

## Overview
Ensure ComplyFlow features work seamlessly with popular WordPress page builders.

## Steps
1. Use supported builders: Elementor, WPBakery, Divi, Beaver Builder, etc.
2. Run accessibility scans on pages built with these tools.
3. Check that consent banners and DSR portals display correctly in builder layouts.
4. If issues arise, use the builder's custom HTML or shortcode widgets to embed ComplyFlow features.
5. Contact support if you encounter compatibility problems.

## Tips
- Always test new builder templates for compliance features.
- Use shortcodes for maximum compatibility.
- Keep both ComplyFlow and your page builder updated.
