# Configuring Form Compliance Settings

## Overview
Ensure all forms on your site collect consent and handle data in compliance with privacy laws.

## Steps
1. Go to **WordPress Admin → ComplyFlow → Forms Compliance**.
2. Review detected forms (Contact Form 7, WPForms, Gravity Forms, Ninja Forms, etc.).
3. Enable consent checkboxes and customize consent text for each form.
4. Set data retention periods and enable automated cleanup if needed.
5. Review consent logs linked to form submissions.

## Tips
- Test each form to ensure consent is collected and logged.
- Use encryption for sensitive fields if required.
- Regularly review retention settings to minimize data risk.
