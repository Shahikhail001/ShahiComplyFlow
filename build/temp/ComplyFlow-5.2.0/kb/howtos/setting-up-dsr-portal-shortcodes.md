# Setting Up DSR Portal Shortcodes

## Overview
Add a Data Subject Rights (DSR) request form to any page using a shortcode.

## Steps
1. Edit or create a WordPress page where you want the DSR portal to appear.
2. Insert the shortcode `[complyflow_dsr_portal]` or `[complyflow_dsr_form]` in the content area.
3. Publish or update the page.
4. Visit the page to verify the DSR form is visible and functional.

## Tips
- Place the DSR portal on your Privacy Policy or a dedicated "Data Requests" page.
- Customize form fields in ComplyFlow settings if needed.
- Test the form by submitting a request and checking admin notifications.
