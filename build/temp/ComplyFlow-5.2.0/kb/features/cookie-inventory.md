# Cookie Inventory

## What is the Cookie Inventory?
The Cookie Inventory module automatically detects, categorizes, and manages all cookies and trackers on your website. It works with the Consent Manager to ensure you meet privacy regulations and provide transparency to your users.

## Key Features

### 1. Automatic Detection
- **Passive Monitoring**: Continuously scans HTTP responses and page scripts to detect all cookies set by your site and third-party services.
- **Third-Party Recognition**: Identifies cookies from popular services (Google Analytics, Facebook, YouTube, Stripe, PayPal, TikTok, LinkedIn, etc.).
- **Metadata Collection**: Captures cookie name, value, provider, expiration, type (first/third-party), and purpose.
- **Manual Add/Edit**: Add or edit cookies that are not automatically detected.

### 2. Categorization
- **Default Categories**: Necessary, Functional, Analytics, Marketing (pre-configured for compliance).
- **Custom Categories**: Create new categories to match your privacy policy or business needs.
- **Bulk Management**: Select and update categories for multiple cookies at once.
- **Consent Linkage**: Each cookie is linked to the consent category for proper blocking/unblocking.

### 3. Inventory Dashboard
- **Centralized View**: See all detected cookies in a sortable, filterable table.
- **Search & Filter**: Quickly find cookies by name, provider, or category.
- **CSV Export**: Download your full cookie inventory for audits or documentation.
- **Policy Integration**: Automatically updates your cookie policy with the latest inventory.

### 4. Reporting & Compliance
- **Stats Tracking**: View stats on cookie usage, category distribution, and consent status.
- **Audit Trail**: All changes to the inventory are logged for compliance.

## How to Use
1. **Run a Scan**: Go to ComplyFlow → Cookie Inventory and click “Scan Now” to detect all cookies.
2. **Review Detected Cookies**: Check the dashboard for new or changed cookies.
3. **Categorize**: Assign each cookie to the correct category. Use bulk actions for efficiency.
4. **Update Policy**: Ensure your cookie policy reflects the current inventory.
5. **Export Data**: Use the CSV export for compliance or sharing with your legal team.

## Troubleshooting & Tips
- If cookies are missing, ensure all scripts are loaded and run a manual scan.
- For custom scripts, add cookies manually to the inventory.
- Regularly review your inventory to catch new cookies from plugin or theme updates.
- Use the audit trail to track changes and demonstrate compliance.

## Advanced Usage
- **REST API**: Access inventory data programmatically for external compliance tools.
- **Developer Hooks**: Extend detection and categorization logic with WordPress hooks.
