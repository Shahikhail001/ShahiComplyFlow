# Analytics and Reporting

## What is Analytics and Reporting?
The Analytics and Reporting module tracks, visualizes, and exports all key compliance metrics for your website. It helps you monitor progress, identify issues, and generate reports for audits, management, or regulatory requests.

## Key Features

### 1. Compliance Scoring
- **Weighted Algorithm**: Calculates a compliance score (0-100) based on accessibility, consent, DSR, cookie, and legal document status.
- **Deduction Model**: Points are deducted for unresolved issues, missing consents, overdue DSRs, and policy gaps.
- **Score Breakdown**: View detailed scores for each compliance area.
- **Letter Grades**: Get an A-F grade for quick assessment.

### 2. Audit Trail
- **Event Logging**: Every scan, consent, DSR request, and document update is logged with details.
- **Timestamps**: Each event is time-stamped for traceability.
- **Admin Viewer**: Filter, search, and review logs in the WordPress dashboard.
- **Export Logs**: Download logs as CSV for external review or compliance checks.

### 3. Report Generation
- **CSV Export**: Export compliance scores, audit trails, and trend data for analysis or sharing.
- **PDF Export**: Create print-ready reports for management or regulatory bodies.
- **Scheduled Reports**: Set up automated report generation and email delivery.

### 4. Trend Analysis
