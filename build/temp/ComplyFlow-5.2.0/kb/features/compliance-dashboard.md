## What is the Compliance Dashboard?
The Compliance Dashboard is your command center for monitoring, managing, and improving your website’s compliance status. It provides real-time insights, actionable widgets, and historical data to help you stay on top of accessibility, privacy, and data subject rights.

## Key Features & Widgets

### 1. Compliance Score
- **Scoring System**: Rates your website's compliance on a scale of 0-100, factoring in accessibility, consent, DSR, and more.
- **Letter Grades**: Easy-to-understand grades (A-F) for quick assessment.
- **Breakdown**: View detailed scores for each compliance area (Accessibility, Consent, DSR, Cookie, Legal).

### 2. Dashboard Widgets
- **Overview Widget**: Shows your overall compliance score, last scan date, and quick status indicators.
- **Recent Activity**: Lists the latest scans, DSR requests, policy updates, and user actions.
- **Quick Actions**: Buttons to run accessibility scans, review DSR requests, update legal documents, and configure consent banners.
- **Accessibility Summary**: Highlights open accessibility issues and their severity.
- **DSR Stats**: Shows pending, completed, and overdue data subject requests.

## How to Use the Dashboard
1. **Access the Dashboard**: Go to WordPress Admin → ComplyFlow → Dashboard.
2. **Review Your Score**: Check the main score and letter grade at the top.
3. **Use Widgets**: Click on quick actions to run scans or manage requests.
4. **Analyze Trends**: Use the trends chart to spot improvements or issues over time.
5. **Export Data**: Use export buttons to download compliance data for audits or reports.

## Troubleshooting & Tips
- If widgets show “No Data,” ensure you’ve run at least one scan and enabled all modules.
- For missing stats, check that your scheduled scans and DSR workflows are active.
- Use the dashboard regularly to catch compliance issues early and act before they become critical.

## Advanced Usage
- **AJAX Updates**: Most widgets update in real time without reloading the page.
- **Custom Widgets**: Developers can add custom widgets using documented hooks and filters.
- **Integration**: Dashboard data can be accessed via REST API for external reporting tools.
