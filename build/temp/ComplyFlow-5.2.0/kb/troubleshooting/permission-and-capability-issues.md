# Permission and Capability Issues

## Problem
Certain plugin features or settings are inaccessible due to insufficient permissions.

## Solution
- Ensure you are logged in as an administrator or a user with the `manage_options` capability.
- Check user roles and capabilities in WordPress.
- Review any custom role or capability plugins that may override defaults.

## Tips
- Only trusted users should have access to compliance settings.
- Use the Members or User Role Editor plugin to manage roles and capabilities.
