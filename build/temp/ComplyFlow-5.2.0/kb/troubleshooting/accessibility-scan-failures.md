# Accessibility Scan Failures

## Problem
Accessibility scans do not complete, return errors, or show no results.

## Solution
- Ensure the site is publicly accessible (no maintenance mode or firewall blocks).
- Check for JavaScript errors in the browser console.
- Verify that all plugin modules and checkers are enabled in settings.
- Review the WordPress debug log for PHP errors.
- Update to the latest version of ComplyFlow.

## Tips
- Run scans after major content or theme changes.
- Use the REST API or WP-CLI for advanced troubleshooting.
