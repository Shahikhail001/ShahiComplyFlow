## Key Concepts
- **Translation File Management**: All user-facing text is translatable via `.pot` files in `/languages/`.
- **Text Domain Usage**: The `complyflow` text domain is used throughout the plugin.
- **RTL Language Support**: CSS and UI are RTL-ready for languages like Arabic and Hebrew.
- **Multi-Language Content**: Integrates with WPML, Polylang, and TranslatePress for multi-language sites.
