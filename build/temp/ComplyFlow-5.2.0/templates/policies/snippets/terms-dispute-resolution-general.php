<h2>Dispute Resolution</h2>

<p>We want to address your concerns without resorting to formal legal proceedings. Before filing a claim against us, you agree to try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting us at {{CONTACT_EMAIL}}. We'll try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting you.</p>

<h3>Informal Resolution</h3>
<p>If you have a dispute with us, you agree to first contact us and attempt to resolve the dispute informally by sending a written notice of your claim ("Notice") to {{CONTACT_EMAIL}}. The Notice must:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Include your name, address, and contact information</li>
    <li>Describe the nature and basis of the claim</li>
    <li>Set forth the specific relief sought</li>
</ul>

<p>If we and you cannot reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 60 days after the Notice is received, you or we may commence formal proceedings as set forth below.</p>

<h3>Time Limitation for Claims</h3>
<p>To the extent permitted by applicable law, any claim or cause of action you may have arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Site must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose, or be forever barred. This limitation period begins to run on the date when you first knew or should have known of the events giving rise to the claim.</p>

<h3>Small Claims Court</h3>
<p>Notwithstanding the provisions in this section, either you or we may bring an individual action in small claims court if the claim qualifies for small claims court in a location where jurisdiction and venue are proper. This option is available as long as the small claims court action remains individual and is not consolidated, joined, or transferred to another court.</p>

<h3>Mediation</h3>
<p>If informal resolution is unsuccessful, either party may propose mediation. If both parties agree to mediation:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The parties will mutually select a mediator or mediation service</li>
    <li>The mediation will be conducted virtually or in a location agreed upon by both parties</li>
    <li>Each party will bear its own costs and attorneys' fees associated with mediation</li>
    <li>The parties will split the fees of the mediator and mediation service equally</li>
    <li>Mediation is non-binding unless both parties agree to a settlement</li>
</ul>

<h3>Class Action Waiver</h3>
<p>TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES' INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, COLLECTIVE, REPRESENTATIVE, MULTIPLE PLAINTIFF, OR SIMILAR PROCEEDING ("CLASS ACTION"). YOU AGREE TO WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</p>

<p>This means that:</p>
<ul>
    <li>You may not bring claims against us as a plaintiff or class member in a class action</li>
    <li>You may not participate in a class action against us brought by others</li>
    <li>An arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims</li>
    <li>An arbitrator may not preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding</li>
</ul>

<p>If this class action waiver is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of the arbitration provision (if applicable) shall be null and void, but all other provisions of these Terms shall remain in effect.</p>

<h3>Jury Trial Waiver</h3>
<p>TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, YOU AND WE EACH WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL in any court proceeding arising from or relating to these Terms or the Site.</p>

<h3>Governing Law</h3>
<p>This Dispute Resolution section shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (where arbitration is applicable) and applicable federal law, or where not preempted by federal law, the laws of [Your Jurisdiction], without regard to principles of conflicts of law.</p>

<h3>Exceptions</h3>
<p>Notwithstanding the above, either party may seek equitable relief (including injunctive relief) in any court of competent jurisdiction to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Protect intellectual property rights</li>
    <li>Prevent actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a party's intellectual property rights</li>
    <li>Enforce confidentiality obligations</li>
</ul>
